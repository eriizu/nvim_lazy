# Debugging

## Keymap

So keybinds would be useful, maybe:
- leader db for breakpoint toggle
- leader dB for resetting breakpoints
- leader ds for stepping in
- leader dn for next instruction
- leader dS for stepping out
- leader dc for continuing
- leader dx for killing the binary

## Rust

I'd like to install nvim-dap and code LLDB.
